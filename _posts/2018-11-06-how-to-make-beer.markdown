# How to Make Beer

A Brief Overview of the Brewing Process

Here’s what you need to know brew beer: **Homebrewing is NOT hard.**

Only four ingredients are needed to make beer:  **water, grain, hops, and yeast.**

Brewers combine these ingredients in countless ways to brew their favorite beers and create their own recipes. 

There are 5 main steps in the brewing process:
1. Make Wort
2. The Boil
3. Pitching Yeast
4. Fermentation
5. Carbonation

## Step 1: Make Wort
**Wort** is unfermented beer - a mixture of water and sugar that’s been extracted from grains which ultimately serves as food for the yeast to consume and create **alcohol**.

Homebrewers typically make wort in one of two ways: combining **malt** extract with water, or steeping milled grains to extract their sugars (sort of like making tea). 

* ***Extract Brewing:*** Add liquid or dry malt extract to heated water 
* ***All Grain Brewing:*** Add crushed (milled), malted grains to water, heated to ~155 degrees and left to , to activate enzymes in the grain which help convert the starch in the grain into simple sugars for the yeast to eat.

## Step 2: The Boil
The heat is increased to bring the wort to a nice, rolling boil. This step sanitizes the wort and initiates the hop-additions phase in brewing. 

Hops are used for their bittering, flavoring, and aromatic qualities. Brewers add them to the wort to counteract beer’s natural sweetness. Hops are added at roughly the following times during the boil:

* *Bittering Hops* - boiled for **60 minutes** (sometimes up to 90 mins) to extract resins which provide bitterness
* *Flavoring Hops* - boiled for **15 minutes** or less to extract oils for taste
* *Finishing Hops* - boiled for **5 minutes** or less, or added after the boil, primarily for adding aroma

Note: Hop additions, both the amounts and the times they’re added, may vary widely depending on the recipe and beer style. For example a bitter IPA will typically have a relatively high amount of hops added at each stage during the boil with even more added later in the process (see Dry Hopping).
