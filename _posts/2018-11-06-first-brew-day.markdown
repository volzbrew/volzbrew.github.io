## Brewing with Malt Extract
Below you’ll find the exact steps we take to brew delicious beer using malt extract.

Before you begin make sure you have the right equipment and ingredients:
* [Brewing Equipment](#) - What we have, use, and recommend
* [Brewing Ingredients](#) - Can’t make beer without these

Brewing is FUN, easy, and your very first batch of beer can turn out great!!!
Just follow the steps below.

Step-by-Step: Extract Brewing

1. Getting Started
2. Making Wort
3. Cooling the Wort and Pitching the Yeast
4. Fermentation
5. Carbonation
6. Getting Started


7.  Getting Started
    1.  Assemble brewing equipment and ingredients
        * Remove yeast from refrigerator (to allow yeast to gradually reach room temperature)
    2. Clean brew pot and stirring spoon - no need to sanitize as these will be used during the boil
    3. Fill brew pot with water, per recipe
    4. Turn on heat to begin bringing water to boil
If called for in recipe: Add, then remove steeping grains as directed

2. Making Wort
    5. Once water is boiling, remove brew pot from heat and slowly stir in **malt extract**
       * **Liquid**: Stir until dissolved, do not allow extract to stick to bottom of pot 
       * **Dry**: add slowly and stir to ensure there are no clumps, **watch closely for boil-overs**
    1. Bring liquid (now called **wort**) back to a rolling boil, then **start 1-hour timer**
        * Try to maintain a vigorous boil but **watch out for boil-overs** unless you love cleaning
    1. **Add hops** per recipe (hop schedule), stir often
    1. During last 10-15 minutes of boil
        * **Add flavoring/finishing hops** per recipe
        * **Add whirlfloc/irish moss** tablet
Place cleaned wort chiller inside brew pot

3. Cooling the Wort and Pitching the Yeast
    9. Use a **wort chiller** to cool the wort as quickly as possible
    1. Pour cooled wort (< 80°F) into a **cleaned AND sanitized fermentation bucket**
        * Splash wort aggressively into bucket to **re-oxygenate** (boiling removes oxygen and the yeast will benefit from aerated wort)
        * Don’t forget to **fill hydrometer** and record readings
    1. Swirl/shake yeast packet to loosen any sediment, then pour (pitch) yeast into cooled wort

4. Fermentation
    12. Cap the fermenter bucket/vessel with a sanitized lid
        * Shake furiously (with lid on) to thoroughly mix yeast and wort
        * Fill airlock with sanitizer (preferred) or vodka (works in a pinch) and set in lid
    1. Store fermenter in secure, dark location with consistent temperature (between 65-75°F)
        * For best results use a temperature-controlled fridge

~24-36 hours after brewing the yeast will be very active so keep an eye on the fermentor/airlock activity. Add dry hops per recipe if applicable, and wait patiently for two weeks (10 days minimum). The yeast will ferment and convert most of the wort’s sugars and create beer!

After two weeks you can keg or bottle your beer to add carbonation and take final hydrometer readings to calculate the alcohol percentage (ABV). 

5. Carbonation
    14. Clean and sanitize keg
    1. Purge oxygen in keg
        * Ensure keg is completely sealed, pump in 5psi CO2, pull manual relief valve (small ring on top of keg) to allow oxygen to escape, repeat twice
    1. Open top of keg and use cleaned and sanitized hose to transfer beer from fermenter into keg
        * If you don’t have a spigot on the fermenter a siphon pump is recommended
    1. Fill hydrometer and take readings
    1. Seal keg once transfer complete and purge oxygen again (see step 15)
    1. Add CO2 to keg to begin carbonation process
        * Slow Carbonation: Add 10psi CO2 and wait 1 week
        * Fast/Forced Carbonation: Add 30psi CO2 3x daily (when you wake up, during lunch/after work, when you go to sleep) for 3 days and test
        * Super Fast/Forced Carbonation (e.g. need to drink now): use a Carbonator and 2 liter bottle, or keg:
            1. Add 30 psi CO2
            1. Shake and/or roll the 2 liter or keg constantly
            1. Every few minutes connect CO2 and pump back up to 30psi, as beer will take in carbonation (you can leave CO2 connected while shaking/rolling if more convenient)
    1. Calculate ABV

Once carbonation is complete you can pour yourself a beer, you deserve it.

## You can now DRINK AND ENJOY your very own homebrew!
