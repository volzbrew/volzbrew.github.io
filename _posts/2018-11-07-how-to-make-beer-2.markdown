# How to Make Beer 2


## Step 3: Pitching Yeast
Cooling the wort as quickly as possible after the boil and prior to transferring the liquid into a fermentation vessel, and pitching (i.e. adding) the yeast, creates an ideal environment for yeast to thrive in. 

Rapidly cooling the wort also has many other benefits such as aiding with beer clarity, reducing DMS (dimethyl sulfide), which can add a cooked- or canned-corn like aroma to beer, and helps decrease the risk of contamination. This is the time when the future beer (woo! future beer!) is most vulnerable to bacteria and other microorganisms (e.g. nasty bugs). 

***Sanitization** is extremely important at this stage to help ward off infection which can lead to off-flavors in the finished beer (gross, no thanks!) Anything that comes in contact with wort after the boil **must** be THOROUGHLY CLEANED AND SANITIZED.* (linky)

Wort chillers are extremely effective for rapidly cooling the wort under 80°F. Once cooled, the wort is then splashed into a fermentation bucket or glass carboy and mixed with the yeast. Splashing the wort helps re-oxygenate the liquid, as boiling removes oxygen, and the yeast will utilize this oxygen while converting wort into **BEER!**

Next, the fermentation vessel is swirled, shaken, and sealed with an airlock. Airlocks filled with sanitizer (preferred) or vodka (works in a pinch; free from impurities) provide a liquid barrier which allow yeast byproducts to escape while prohibiting contaminants from getting in.

## Step 4: Fermentation 
This is where the magic happens. Yeast consume the wort’s sugars and convert them into alcohol, making BEER! 

Fermentation vessels should be stored in a dark place out of direct sunlight with consistent temperatures. Fermentation temperature should be kept between 65-75°F, ideally 68-72°F (different ranges for lagering), for at least 10-12 days. 

*Temperature control is very important! Higher temperatures and/or large fluctuations stress yeast which can lead to off-flavors. Lower temperatures can slow down and inhibit crucial yeast processes which increase the risk of infection.*

During the first few days keeping a close eye on the fermenter is important. The yeast will become very active, furiously consuming the primary sugars, before settling down and completing their job. Watch out for airlock clogging during the first few days. This can lead to a build-up of pressure inside the fermenting bucket and cause the lid to pop of and spew wort all over the walls.(Trust us, this happened at four in the morning and sounded like a gun went off!)

## Step 5: Carbonation
The last step is to carbonate the **beer** (BEER!). Carbonation is crucial as the tiny bubbles impact aroma, mouthfeel, perceived body, and really just make beer taste refreshing!

This can be done easily by transferring the beer to a keg, purging the oxygen, and adding CO2 (linky). 

Honestly, we haven’t bottled our beer. We started out with ‘Corny’ kegs and they’ve been great. We cannot recommend enough how awesome kegs are: **Kegs are awesome!**

*If you don’t have a keg you basically clean 50+ bottles (can’t use the dishwasher), add sugar to your beer (more food for yeast to create carbonation), then bottle and cap the beer and wait another 2 weeks.*
